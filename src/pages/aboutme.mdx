        For this portfolio, I aimed to take a creative and unconventional approach.
        Since this site is geared towards developers, I set out to recreate something familiar to us: our beloved IDE, Visual Studio Code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the Astro Framework as a foundation, I replicated each section of the IDE, incorporating some React components.
        Each page is presented as an MDX file formatted in Markdown, stylized to resemble the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the README file, I provided instructions to discover some Easter eggs.
        I hope you like it; personally, I had a great time creating this portfolio.
