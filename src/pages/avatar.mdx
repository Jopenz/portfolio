        Barrington Avatar, a project conceived for the visualization of fabrics in different styles of men's suits, was realized with the combination of NestJs
        for the backend and React for the frontend, supported by DynamoDB from AWS as a database.
      </p>
      <p>
        The development of the project was divided into two phases. During the first stage, the core of the system was established, while the second stage
        focused on extending additional functionalities and completely overhauling the frontend.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core of the system comprises a complete Backoffice, with user authentication, which allows the insertion, modification and deletion of information
        in an efficient and secure manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the final result of the project was integrated to the client's website through an iframe. This implementation gave the client the flexibility
        to move the project between different websites within their domain.
